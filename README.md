# Python Note

## printing with various format placeholders

In Python f-strings, placeholders are enclosed in curly braces {} and can contain various format specifiers and expressions to format values. Here are some common placeholders and format specifiers you can use within f-strings:

1. Basic Value Insertion:
     - {variable}: Insert the value of the variable.
     - {expression}: Insert the result of the expression.

2. String Formatting:
   - {variable:s}: Insert the value of the variable as a string.
   - {variable:<width}: Left-align the string within a field of the specified width.
   - {variable:^width}: Center-align the string within a field of the specified width.
   - {variable:>width}: Right-align the string within a field of the specified width.
   - {variable:.precisionf}: Format a floating-point number with the specified precision.
   - {variable:.precisions}: Format a string with the specified length (right-padded with spaces if needed).

3. Integer Formatting:

      - {variable:d}: Insert the value of the variable as an integer.
      - {variable:widthd}: Format an integer with a minimum field width.
      - {variable:0widthd}: Format an integer with leading zeros.
        
4. Floating-Point Formatting:

- {variable:f}: Insert the value of the variable as a floating-point number.
- {variable:.precisionf}: Format a floating-point number with the specified precision.
- {variable:e}: Format a floating-point number in scientific notation.
- {variable:.precisione}: Format a floating-point number in scientific notation with the specified precision.

4. Hexadecimal and Binary Formatting:

- {variable:x}: Format an integer as a hexadecimal string (lowercase).
- {variable:X}: Format an integer as a hexadecimal string (uppercase).
- {variable:b}: Format an integer as a binary string.
Date and Time Formatting:

- {variable:%format}: Format a datetime object using Python's strftime format.
For example, here's how you can use some of these placeholders and format specifiers in f-strings:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
pi = 3.14159

print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
print(f"Value of pi: {pi:.2f}")
print(f"Binary representation of 10: {10:b}")
```
